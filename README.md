ClassControl - Classroom Management System
A personal project focused on improving web development skills and practicing database integration using MySQL and SQLite with Python.
Built with 💻 dedication and a passion for learning!

💡 About the Project
ClassControl is a web-based application designed to assist with classroom administration, offering features like:

Student and teacher registration

Attendance tracking

Task and grade management

User dashboard for viewing and editing data

Login system using student ID and password

This project is a hands-on journey to explore new tools and best practices, combining backend development with a clean, interactive frontend (React coming soon!).

🛠️ Tech Stack
💾 Backend:
Python 3

Flask (or FastAPI – potential future switch)
